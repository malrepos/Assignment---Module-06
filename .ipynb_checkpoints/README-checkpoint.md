# Assignment---Module-06

# Unit 6: Housing Rental Analysis for San Francisco

### Introduction

The focus of this project is to use python visualization tools in order to plot data.

Visualizing data can be an invauable tool to make sense of data and to communicate the story in a more appealing and potentially more easily understandable way.

Visualized data has the potential to present data in a clear, succinct way, allowing the viewer to get the most important facts and trends from the data almost immediately.

In order to produce more interactive plots I have used hvplot (HoloViews) instead of matplotlib.

In this project I use:

* bar graphs
* line graphs
* GeoViews


### Requirements

This project is completed in a Jupyter Lab notebook.

For this notebook you need to import the following modules:

* import pandas as pd
* from pathlib import Path
* import pandas.hvplot


### Configuration

There are no special configuration instructions for this project.

As per Jupyter Lab notebooks, it is important to run each cell sequentally to ensure all required modules are imported and data manipulation has been performed.


### FAQ

The data in this project - San Fransisco housing data - was not gathered or generated by me.
